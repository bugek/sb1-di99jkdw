# Production Planning System Documentation

## Overview
A comprehensive production planning system built with NestJS, MongoDB, and TypeScript. The system helps manage and optimize production processes, raw materials, and reporting.

## Architecture

### Core Modules
1. **Process Planning**
   - Manages production processes
   - Handles process scheduling and optimization
   - Integrates AI/ML for process optimization

2. **Product Planning**
   - Manages product definitions and requirements
   - Handles production scheduling
   - Provides demand prediction capabilities

3. **Raw Materials**
   - Manages inventory of raw materials
   - Tracks material usage and availability
   - Predicts material shortages

4. **Reporting**
   - Generates production reports
   - Provides cost analysis
   - Offers performance metrics

### Shared Components
- **Utils**: Reusable utility functions
- **Services**: Common services like date handling and validation
- **Interfaces**: Base interfaces and types
- **Middleware**: Authentication and other middleware
